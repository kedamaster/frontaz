## Installation

Requirements for frontend installation;

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager): Most modern frontend frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, require Node.js and npm to be installed on the development machine. Node.js provides the runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server-side, and npm is the package manager used to install and manage frontend dependencies.

Code Editor: Developers typically use a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom, to write, edit, and manage the frontend code.

Tailwind: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines web development by providing a set of pre-designed utility classes.Tailwind’s approach shifts focus from traditional CSS components to functional classes, empowering developers to efficiently build responsive and visually appealing interfaces with minimal effort. 

This module is in github. `dependencies`:

```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
```
ng serve
```
## How to Install and use Tailwind CSS 

Step 1:
```
npm init -y
```
Step 2:
```
npm install tailwindcss
```
Step 3:Use the @tailwind directive to inject Tailwind’s base, components, and utility styles into your CSS file.

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Step 4: This is used to create a config file to customize the designs. It is an optional step.

```
npx tailwindcss init
```
Step 5:This command is used to compile style.css is the file that has to be compiled and output.css is the file on which it has to be compiled. If the file output.css is not created earlier then it will automatically be created.

```
npx tailwindcss build styles.css -o output.css
```
